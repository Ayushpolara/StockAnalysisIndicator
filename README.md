# StockAnalysisIndicator

StockAnalysisIndicator is a comprehensive tool for analyzing stock performance using various technical indicators. This project provides implementations of several widely-used indicators that help in making informed trading decisions. Below is a description of each implemented indicator:

### 1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)
The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a basic technical indicator that calculates the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, over a specified period. The SMA smooths out price data to identify trends and potential buy or sell signals. It is calculated by summing up the prices over the period and dividing by the number of periods.

### 2. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is similar to the SMA but gives more weight to recent prices. This makes the EMA more responsive to recent price changes, which helps in identifying short-term trends more accurately. The EMA is calculated using a smoothing factor, which adjusts the weight given to the most recent price data.

### 3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a stock. An RSI above 70 typically indicates that a stock is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests that it is oversold.

### 4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stockâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. A signal line, which is the 9-period EMA of the MACD, is then plotted on top of the MACD line to identify buy or sell signals.

### 5. Chaikin Money Flow Index (CMFI)
The Chaikin Money Flow Index (CMFI) is a volume-weighted average of accumulation and distribution over a specified period. It measures the buying and selling pressure for a security. The CMFI ranges from -1 to +1 and helps in identifying the strength of a trend. A positive CMFI value indicates buying pressure, while a negative value indicates selling pressure.

### 6. Keltner Channel (SBI-Keltner Channel)
The Keltner Channel is a volatility-based indicator that consists of three lines: the middle line is an EMA of the price, and the upper and lower bands are calculated by adding and subtracting a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) from the EMA. The Keltner Channel helps in identifying overbought and oversold conditions and potential breakouts.

Each of these indicators plays a crucial role in technical analysis and can be used in conjunction with one another to enhance trading strategies. The StockAnalysisIndicator project provides robust implementations of these indicators, making it a valuable tool for traders and analysts.
